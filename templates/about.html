      <h1>Who We Are?</h1>
      <h2>We're engineers who is working on Quantum computer at Silicon Valley.Just kidding :D. We're just two friends from the same school and class at 11th grade. We're interested in coding and we're trying to learn something new. We saw this "Creating
        Best Blog"
        competition and we decided to work on it. SedAtmaca (C.Sedat Atmaca) is trying to code front-end of our website with HTML-CSS and CosmicOwl(İftihar M. Çırçır) is working on back-end with Pyhton. To be honest we wanted to make more
        things but we're studying at the same time. Because of that we couldn't make most of things. But we will. Follow Us! </h2>
